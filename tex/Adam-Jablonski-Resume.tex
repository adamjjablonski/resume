\subsection{Ford Motor Company $|$ {\normalfont Dearborn, MI} \hfill 2021--2025}

\subsubsection{Software Development Engineer in Test \hfill Nov 2023--May 2025}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Contributed core functionality, including automated test configuration,
  vehicle interaction (ignition control, DTC logging, etc.), on-vehicle 
  diagnostic logging, and remote log streaming, to In-Vehicle Automation (IVA), 
  an automated over-the-air update (OTA) test orchestrator and executor, achieving 135,000 fully 
  automated in-vehicle OTA update test runs and counting.
  \item Collaborated with cross-functional teams to identify opportunities for 
  automation and translate OTA update end-to-end test requirements into functional requirements and user stories for IVA testing framework.
  \item Authored technical documentation in Confluence covering the IVA system 
  architecture, hardware and software setup process, opportunities for extension and customization, and best usage practices.
  \item Onboarded new hires to development and testing tools, frameworks, and practices; held training sessions for newly developed automation 
  tools; mentored junior test engineers and analysts; and wrote on-boarding guides.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Software Test Engineer (Contract)\hfill July 2021--Nov 2023}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Designed, implemented, and maintained Vehicle Logging Client (VLC),
  a Python CLI tool that reduced manual OTA test execution time by 5-10 minutes 
  per run by automating logging instrumentation setup and teardown, monitoring 
  log health, and organizing test data for triage.
  \item Created comprehensive Confluence documentation for VLC; held global training 
  sessions to pitch and introduce VLC to other teams within Ford product development;
  provided ongoing user onboarding and troubleshooting support, increasing team-wide 
  tool adoption to over 95\%.
  \item Performed manual OTA update regression testing on both hardware test 
  benches (integration testing) and development and production vehicles 
  (end-to-end testing), analyzing system logs to root-cause update failures, 
  documenting defect details and steps to reproduce in Jira, and verifying fixes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ZF Group $|$ {\normalfont Fowlerville, MI} \hfill 2017--2019}

\subsubsection{Engineering Intern (Contract) \hfill May 2017--Oct 2019}

  unit end-of-line test stand to add compatability for incoming General Motors 
  Global B E/E architecture.
  \item Enhanced a Java-based cross-platform quality reporting and data 
  querying application, utilizing the JavaFX platform for rich graphical user 
  interfaces and enabling assembly staff to more easily submit quality reports 
  and query traceability data from the plant's Oracle SQL database.
  \item Fabricated, installed, and documented automatic test equipment (ATE) 
  components—including test fixtures and wire harnesses—for end-of-line test 
  stands, ensuring final verification of ABS electronic and hydraulic control 
  unit functionality before shipping to customers.
